Modern Good Practices for Python Development

Python's type system explained: Static vs dynamic typing

Type Hints should be used by Professional Developers
Type hints are the biggest change in the history of Python since the unification of types and classes in Python 2.2, released in 2001. However, type hints do not benefit all Python users equally. That‚Äôs why they should always be optional.

The goal of Type Hints is to help developer tools find bugs in Python codebases via static analysis, i.e., without actually running the code through tests. The main beneficiaries are professional software engineers using IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) and CI (Continuous Integration). The cost-benefit analysis that makes type hints attractive to this group does not apply to all users of Python. However, we are professional developers, therefore it is beneficial for us to adopt type hints. This Modern Python course uses Type Hints extensively.
