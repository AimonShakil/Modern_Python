    "### Concepts: \n",
    "Classes are blueprint. why there is a need of OOP, progrmming went through different paradigms initally there was ```linear programming```, means we have to code line by line, then evolutionized as Paradiym of ```structured/ procedural/ controlled programming```\n",
    "and control blocks of if else, for loop, try and catch controlls allows structured programming, but even there was problem like after code its management it is difficult to manage, for that advanced pyradigm or structure of programming is ```Object Oriented Programming``` what is OOP Purpose? everything is Object and it has methods(actions Performed) and Properties/ Attributes (name, fname, education , no action but information being stored). Bascially code updation is a challanging task. So class is a Architecture \n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose in real world: Scientists classified similar Objects and made classes as in Biology like specific classes of animal and plants like of similar methods and properties , when we make big sysrems, classes have relations consider making a university management system core classes could be Management, assets, student, teachers. there is an ERD diagram, it is at the level of DB and before making a big appliation we make a ERD Diagram creating a links of elements with each other also we learn UML Diagrams and at the end we convert the end result to OOP and based on architecture we can use any OOP java, python , TS or C##\n",
